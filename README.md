# Deep-Learning 

1.Simple image classification

This is a simple deep learning project to classify images of handwritten digits.  
firstly the basics of building single layer neural network are covered.  
latter 2 extra layers are added.  
a.for flattening the matrix data,  
b.extra hidden layer 

2.Activation functions and implementation
3. Matrix basics in python using numpy
