# Deep-Learning Simple image classification

This is a simple deep learning project to classify images of handwritten digits.  
firstly the basics of building single layer neural network are covered.  
latter 2 extra layers are added.  
1.for flattening the matrix data,  
2.extra hidden layer 

2 code files are commited above :
